0,What did the president say about Justice Breyer?,The president thanked Justice Stephen Breyer for his service and honored him during the State of the Union address. He also announced that he had nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to succeed Justice Breyer.,"['Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.'
 'And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.'
 'A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. \n\nAnd if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system.'
 'As I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential. \n\nWhile it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice.']",['The president said that Justice Breyer has dedicated his life to serve the country and thanked him for his service.'],The president said that Justice Breyer has dedicated his life to serve the country and thanked him for his service.,0.99999999995,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.8935946971650294
1,What did the president say about Intel's CEO?,"The president mentions Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger, as someone who is willing to increase their investment in manufacturing if a certain bill is passed. The president also notes that Intel is building a $20 billion semiconductor ""mega site"" with up to eight factories and 10,000 new jobs.","['But that’s just the beginning. \n\nIntel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight, told me they are ready to increase their investment from  \n$20 billion to $100 billion. \n\nThat would be one of the biggest investments in manufacturing in American history. \n\nAnd all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill. \n\nSo let’s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk. I’ll sign it.  \n\nAnd we will really take off. \n\nAnd Intel is not alone. \n\nThere’s something happening in America.'
 'This is where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build its $20 billion semiconductor “mega site”. \n\nUp to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. 10,000 new good-paying jobs. \n\nSome of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and our everyday lives. \n\nSmartphones. The Internet. Technology we have yet to invent. \n\nBut that’s just the beginning.'
 'For the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else. \n\nBut that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century. \n\nVice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America.'

2,What did the president say about gun violence?,"The president asked Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence, including universal background checks, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and repealing the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers immune from lawsuits. He also emphasized the need to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns that can't be traced.","['And I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? \n\nBan assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \n\nRepeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued. \n\nThese laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives.'

But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.'
 'We should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. \n\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.  \n\nAnd I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced.']",['The president asked Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence.'],The president asked Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence.,0.7499999999625,1.0,1.0,0.9057764885319283
